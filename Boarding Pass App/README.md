## Learning Objective(s):

- [x] Build a Constraint Scrolling Layout along with nested views and vector images
- [x] Create a data binding class to link the UI to constant values
- [x] Implement a Landscape layout to make the app responsive 

## Best Practices and Takeaways 

-	Understanding how View Groups and Constraint Layout allow for more complex (but still clean) UIs
-	A more in-depth look at different styling attributes for various types of Views
-	Learning more about Android Studioâ€™s Hierarchy Viewer and how tree depth and View nesting impact app rendering speed during runtime performance
-	Using locale files to make apps more accessible to international end users
-	Structuring layout directories and XML files to improve responsiveness

## App Dependencies: 
-	'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.1.0'
-	'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.0-beta4'

**Target SDK Version:** 25
