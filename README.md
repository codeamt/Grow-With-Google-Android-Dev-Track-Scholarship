## About the Challenge Course
The [Grow With Google](https://grow.google/developers/) Course, in partnership with Udacity, presented a 3 month challenge to complete 13 lessons, 10 sample apps and a final Capstone App project, entitled Sunshine. Throughout the process, we received mentorship TAs and moral encouragement from fellow classmates in our our course Slack channel.
